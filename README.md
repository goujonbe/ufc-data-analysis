## Introduction

The [UFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship) is the largest MMA organization in the world. The roster of high-level fighters is awesome. [Conor McGregor](http://www.ufc.com/fighter/Conor-McGregor), [Ronda Rousey](https://www.ufc.com/fighter/Ronda-Rousey) and [Georges Saint-Pierre](https://www.ufc.com/fighter/Georges-St-Pierre) are known around the world. At a first glance, it may seem very brutal but mixed martial arts are extremely technical and strategical.

As in many sports, data is essential. It is primordial for fighters of course but for many others too: journalists/analysts, gamblers, and fans.

I fought this topic was interesting because there was no data set at the time I began this project.

So, it was an end-to-end data science project from data acquisition to communication of the results through data wrangling and of course data analysis.
